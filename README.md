## Overview
PoseMate is an advanced human pose estimation app that leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to analyze and predict human poses in real time. It can detect and track key body points, making it ideal for applications in fitness, healthcare, gaming, and augmented reality.

## Features
- **Real-time pose estimation**: Analyze poses from live camera feeds or uploaded videos/images.
- **Keypoint detection**: Detects joints and key body landmarks (e.g., shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.).
- **High accuracy**: Powered by state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Cross-platform support**: Available on web and mobile platforms.
- **Use cases**: Fitness tracking, physical therapy, gaming, and more.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch / Computer Vision
- **Other Tools**: OpenCV
